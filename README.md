# CNN models for binary classification of pneumonia and brain tumor detection. \ 

Here I will expain how to run the files in the repository \
Details regarding different metrics and operations performed on the dataset are present in the project report of this repository.

# Data Sets

In the Drive_Links_Datasets.txt file of this repo, links for the brain tumor and pneumonia image datasets is present. \
Click on each of the links and download the datasets. \ 
Upload these datasets on your google drive.(Note: It will take around an hour for the files to upload as the dataset is large)

#  Google colab

Go to colab.research.google.com \
Mount your drive to google cable (https://www.marktechpost.com/2019/06/07/how-to-connect-google-colab-with-google-drive/)(This is useful post for mounting your google drive to colab)\

# Upload and running the ipynb files

Two ipynb files are present in this repo for Brain tumor and pneumonia respectively\
You can individually upload both files on google colab and run all the cells to get the output\
(Note: change the runtime type to GPU for faster execution)
